# GOTH - Go Template for Hexagonal Architecture

GOTH is a clean, modern Go template for building robust backend applications based on hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters), inspired by [go-clean-template](https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template).

## Features

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation between domain logic and external adapters
- **Multi-platform Support**: Builds for amd64, arm, and arm64 architectures
- **Domain-Driven Structure**: Organized by business domains
- **Multiple Delivery Methods**: HTTP (Fiber) and AMQP RPC
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with SQLC code generation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Caching**: Redis integration
- **Dependency Injection**: Wire-based DI
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration
- **Logging**: Structured logging with zerolog
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- **Testing**: Complete test suite with mocking
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow
- **Docker Support**: Dockerized application with multi-stage builds
- **Hot Reload**: Development with Air for quick iterations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/savioruz/goth.git
cd goth
```

2. Set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Configure timezone (important for consistent datetime handling):

Edit your `.env` file and set the `APP_TIMEZONE` variable:

```bash
# Example for Indonesia (UTC+7)
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Jakarta

# Example for UTC (default)
APP_TIMEZONE=UTC
```

**Note**: The application handles all datetime operations in the configured timezone, regardless of the database timezone setting. This ensures consistent behavior across different deployment environments.

4. Run the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Run the migrations:

```bash
make migrate.up
```

### Dev

For development, you can use Air for hot reloading:

```bash
make dev
```

### Help

For help with the Makefile commands, run:

```bash
make help
```
